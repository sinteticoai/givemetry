# GiveMetry Project Brief

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Updated:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Aligned with Architecture v2.0

---

## Executive Summary

GiveMetry is an **AI-powered intelligence layer for university advancement offices** that transforms existing CRM data into actionable insights. Unlike competitors that require CRM replacement or add complexity, GiveMetry works alongside Blackbaud, Salesforce, and other systems to answer the question advancement leaders ask daily: **"Where do we stand, and what should we do next?"**

### The Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Market Size (TAM)** | $4.5-5.5B nonprofit software market |
| **Intelligence Layer SAM** | $800M-$1.2B addressable |
| **Beachhead Segment** | 400-800 mid-tier universities |
| **Year 3 SOM** | $10M-$30M ARR |

### The Problem

- **46% of gift officers plan to leave** within 2 years (burnout crisis)
- **49% use AI** but only **9% have policies** (governance gap)
- **75% of CRM implementations fail** to deliver promised value
- **40%+ of advancement services time** spent on manual reporting
- Gift officers manage **150+ prospects** with no prioritization intelligence

### The Solution

A **governance-first, CRM-agnostic intelligence platform** that:
1. Delivers actionable "who to call today" recommendations
2. Provides auditable, explainable AI scoring
3. Measures outcomes (meetings → asks → gifts closed)
4. Requires no CRM replacement or complex integration

### Why Now

1. **Microsoft exiting** nonprofit market (Dec 2026) — forces migration decisions
2. **EverTrue acquired DonorSearch** (Sept 2025) — consolidation validates category
3. **Blackbaud-Anthropic partnership** (Dec 2025) — incumbents partnering, not building
4. **AI adoption accelerating** — 80% experimented, but need "governance-first" solutions

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Advancement Office Crisis

University advancement offices face a perfect storm:

| Challenge | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Staff burnout** | 46% of gift officers plan to leave within 2 years |
| **Portfolio overload** | MGOs manage 150-250 prospects (standard is 75-150) |
| **Data paralysis** | Wealth screenings from 3+ years ago sit untouched |
| **Tool fatigue** | Average office uses 5-7 disconnected systems |
| **Reporting burden** | 40%+ of advancement services time on manual reports |

### 1.2 The Technology Gap

Current solutions fail because they're either:

**CRM Platforms (Blackbaud, Salesforce)**
- Excellent systems of record, weak systems of action
- AI features are incremental (acknowledgments, chat, summaries)
- Expensive ($3,375/mo+ for Blackbaud, $900/user/yr for Einstein)
- Require significant implementation and customization

**Point Solutions (iWave, DonorSearch, Windfall)**
- Deliver scores and data, not actionable recommendations
- Create additional data silos
- "Just another score" without workflow integration
- No outcome measurement or attribution

**Workflow Overlays (EverTrue, Gravyty)**
- Require significant adoption/behavior change
- Feel like "another platform" vs. intelligence layer
- Expensive for mid-market ($$$$ enterprise pricing)
- Heavy integration lift

### 1.3 The Whitespace

**No solution owns:** CRM-agnostic AI intelligence that delivers daily prioritization, measures outcomes, and includes governance controls — without requiring CRM replacement.

> **"We have plenty of data. We have wealth screenings from three years ago we haven't touched. I don't need more data; I need to know which 5 people my gift officer should call tomorrow."**
> — Director of Research, Private University

## 3. Target Market & Beachhead Strategy

### 3.1 Beachhead Segment: Mid-Tier Research Universities

**Definition:** R2 doctoral + Master's institutions with $100M-$1B endowments using Blackbaud or Salesforce CRM

| Criterion | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Carnegie Classification | R2 (139) + Master's Large/Medium (~500) |
| Endowment | $100M-$1B |
| Advancement team size | 5-25 staff |
| CRM platform | Blackbaud RE NXT or Salesforce |
| **Total addressable** | **400-600 institutions** |

### 3.2 Why This Segment

| Factor | Rating | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Pain intensity** | ★★★★★ | Data exists but no analytics; "enterprise data with SMB staffing" |
| **Budget authority** | ★★★★☆ | $15K-$50K within VP discretion |
| **Sales cycle** | ★★★★☆ | 4-9 months (vs. 12-18 for R1) |
| **Case study value** | ★★★★☆ | Relatable to peers; creates proof for expansion |
| **Competition** | ★★★★☆ | Underserved by expensive enterprise solutions |
| **Data readiness** | ★★★★☆ | Mature CRM usage, historical data exists |

### 3.3 Segment Comparison

| Segment | Pain | Budget | Cycle | Competition | Recommendation |
|---------|------|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| R1 Elite (~50) | High | High | 12-18 mo | High | Phase 2 (reference customers) |
| R1 Standard (~137) | High | High | 9-12 mo | High | Phase 2 |
| **R2 (~139)** | **Very High** | **Medium-High** | **6-9 mo** | **Medium** | **PRIMARY** |
| **Master's Large (~200)** | **Very High** | **Medium** | **4-6 mo** | **Low** | **PRIMARY** |
| Small Private (~1,500) | Medium | Low | 2-3 mo | High | Not now |
| Hospital Foundations | High | Medium-High | 6-9 mo | Medium | Phase 2 (compliance required) |

### 3.4 Disqualification Criteria

Do **not** pursue initially:
- Institutions with <$50M endowment (budget constraints)
- Institutions without dedicated advancement office (no buyer)
- 2-year/community colleges (different economics)
- Healthcare without HIPAA compliance design (Phase 2)
- General nonprofits <$10M revenue (fragmented, low data maturity)

### 4.2 Direct Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Positioning | AI Strength | Vulnerability | Price Point |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **EverTrue + DonorSearch** | Data + workflow combined | ★★★★ | Integration complexity post-merger; expensive | Enterprise (quote) |
| **Gravyty** | AI email drafting + engagement | ★★★☆ | Point solution feel; requires heavy CRM integration | Enterprise (quote) |
| **iWave/Kindsight** | Wealth screening + scoring | ★★★★ | "Just a score" without workflow; rigid contracts | $4,150/yr+ |
| **Windfall** | Consumer wealth data | ★★★☆ | Data only, not workflow; contract complaints | $1,500-$5,000/yr |
| **Bloomerang** | Donor retention CRM | ★★★☆ | SMB focus; replaces CRM vs. complements | $125/mo+ |
| **Ovrture** | Major donor stewardship | ★★☆☆ | Narrow lane (stewardship only) | Custom |
| **Fundraise Up** | Donation conversion | ★★★★ | Transactional only; no major gift workflow | 4% transaction |

### 4.3 Incumbent CRM AI Status

| Incumbent | Current AI | Gap |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Blackbaud** | Copilot (preview), AI acknowledgments, Prospect Insights | Incremental features, not intelligence layer; slow rollout |
| **Salesforce** | Einstein summaries, gift proposals, prediction builder | Powerful but expensive ($900/user/yr); requires customization |

**Strategic implication:** Incumbents are adding AI as features, not building dedicated intelligence layers. They're also partnering (Blackbaud-Anthropic) rather than acquiring, leaving whitespace for specialized solutions.

### 4.4 Competitive Differentiation

| Dimension | Competitors | GiveMetry |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| CRM relationship | Replace or integrate tightly | Complement any CRM |
| AI transparency | Black box scoring | Explainable, auditable |
| Outcome measurement | None or basic | Closed-loop attribution |
| Governance | Afterthought | First-class (audit, privacy, bias) |
| Implementation | 3-12 months | Days to weeks |
| Entry point | Enterprise commitment | Low-risk diagnostic |

| **Total** | **4-9 months** | — | Faster than R1 (12-18 months) |

### 6.4 Budget Thresholds

| Price Point | Approval Required | GiveMetry Alignment |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| <$15K | Director/AVP discretionary | **Phase 1 Diagnostic** ($2K-$10K) |
| $15K-$50K | VP Advancement approval | **Core Platform** ($20K-$40K) |
| $50K-$100K | VP + IT security + procurement | Avoided for initial market |
| >$100K | Executive + legal + board | Not initial target |

### 6.5 Decision Criteria (Ranked)

| Rank | Criterion | Weight | What They Evaluate |

| "What's the ROI?" | "We measure meetings → asks → gifts. You'll see results in 60-90 days." |
| "IT won't approve another tool" | "We provide HECVAT and SOC 2 documentation on day one, with SSO available in Phase 2. Happy to present to IT directly." |
