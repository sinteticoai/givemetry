# GiveMetry - Project Info

## Overview

GiveMetry is an AI-powered analytics platform for university advancement offices (fundraising/development). It serves as an intelligence layer that works with existing CRMs (Blackbaud, Salesforce) rather than replacing them.

**Core Value Proposition:** Transform donor data into actionable intelligence for advancement teams — answering "Where do we stand, and what should we do next?"

## Product Phases

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Advancement Health Assessment | One-time diagnostic: CSV upload → AI analysis → peer benchmarking → actionable report |
| 2 | MGO Copilot | Daily workflow tool for gift officers with prioritized tasks, donor briefs, outreach drafts |
| 3 | Advancement Intelligence Platform | Full platform: campaign forecasting, portfolio optimization, predictive modeling |

## Target Market

- **Primary:** University advancement offices (higher education)
- **Secondary:** Hospital foundations, large nonprofits
- **Beachhead TBD:** Pending market sizing research

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Advancement Office:** University fundraising/development department
- **Gift Officer / MGO:** Major Gift Officer - manages donor relationships
- **Portfolio:** A gift officer's assigned set of donor prospects (typically 75-150)
- **Moves Management:** Structured approach to cultivating donors toward gifts
- **CASE:** Council for Advancement and Support of Education (industry association)

## Competitive Positioning

- **Not a CRM replacement** — Intelligence layer on top of existing systems
- **Diagnostic-first approach** — Build trust before asking for deeper access
- **CRM-agnostic** — Works with Blackbaud, Salesforce, or any system via CSV export

## Key Metrics (from research)

- 46% of gift officers plan to leave within 2 years
- Only 5% of nonprofits use AI/cognitive systems
- 75% of CRM implementation projects fail
- Blackbaud RE NXT starts at $3,375/month
