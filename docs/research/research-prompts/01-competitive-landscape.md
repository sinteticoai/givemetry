## Context

I'm building an AI-powered analytics platform for university advancement offices (fundraising/development). The platform will serve as an intelligence layer that works with existing CRMs (Blackbaud, Salesforce) rather than replacing them. I need comprehensive competitive intelligence to inform product positioning and feature prioritization.
