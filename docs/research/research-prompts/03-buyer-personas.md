## Context

I'm building an AI-powered analytics platform for university advancement offices. I need to understand who makes purchasing decisions, how they evaluate vendors, and what drives their decisions. This will inform go-to-market strategy and sales process design.

## Primary Research Questions

### 1. Organizational Structure

- What is the typical organizational structure of a university advancement office?
- What titles/roles exist (VP Advancement, CDO, AVP, Director of Annual Giving, etc.)?
- Who reports to whom?
- Where does data/analytics typically sit in the org structure?
- What is the relationship between Advancement and IT/CIO office?

### 2. Buyer Personas

For each key persona, I need:
- Title and typical background
- Key responsibilities and success metrics
- Pain points and frustrations
- Technology sophistication level
- Budget authority and spending limits
- Information sources they trust (publications, conferences, peers)

**Personas to profile:**
- Vice President of Advancement / Chief Development Officer
- Associate VP / Director of Advancement Services
- Director of Prospect Research
- Director of Annual Giving
- Major Gift Officer (end user, not buyer)
- CIO / Director of Enterprise Applications (IT stakeholder)

### 3. Purchase Process

- What triggers a technology purchase in advancement?
- What is the typical evaluation process (RFP, pilot, committee)?
- Who is involved in the decision (buying committee composition)?
- What are typical deal timelines (months from first contact to close)?
- What procurement hurdles exist (security review, legal, IT approval)?
- What budget cycles apply (fiscal year timing)?

### 4. Decision Criteria

- What factors matter most when selecting advancement technology?
- How do buyers weight: price vs. features vs. integration vs. vendor reputation?
- What objections or concerns delay or kill deals?
- What role do peer references play?
- How important is "rip and replace" fear vs. complementary solutions?

### 5. Conferences & Communities

- What conferences do advancement professionals attend?
  - CASE (Council for Advancement and Support of Education)
  - AFP (Association of Fundraising Professionals)
  - AHP (Association for Healthcare Philanthropy)
  - Others?
- What online communities or publications do they follow?
- What vendors typically sponsor or exhibit at these events?

### 6. Pricing Expectations

- What do advancement offices expect to pay for analytics/intelligence tools?
- Is per-user pricing, flat fee, or usage-based preferred?
- What is the threshold for VP-level approval vs. requiring higher sign-off?
- Are there common budget line items this would fall under?
