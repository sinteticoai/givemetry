## 1. Organizational Structure

### Typical Advancement Office Hierarchy

| Level | Typical Titles | Reports To |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Executive | VP Advancement, CDO, VP Development & Alumni Relations | University President |
| Senior Director | AVP Advancement Services, Exec Director Operations | VP Advancement |
| Director | Director Prospect Research, Director Annual Giving, Director Major Gifts | AVP or VP Advancement |
| Frontline | Major Gift Officers, Prospect Researchers, Gift Processing Staff | Director-level |

### Data/Analytics Positioning (Critical for Sales)

Data and analytics functions typically sit within **Advancement Services, not central IT**. This is critical for sales strategy—the advancement office controls its own technology stack for most purchases under $50K.

- **Advancement Services owns:** CRM, prospect research tools, reporting/analytics, gift processing systems
- **Central IT (CIO) involved for:** Security review, enterprise integrations, data governance approval
- **Key Dynamic:** Advancement has autonomy for "best of breed" tools but must coordinate with IT for data access and SSO
