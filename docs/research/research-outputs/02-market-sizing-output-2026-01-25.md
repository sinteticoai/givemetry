## 7. TAM/SAM/SOM Model

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Global nonprofit software market:** $5.5B (2024) → $7.3B (2029)

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**U.S. higher education + healthcare advancement technology:**

| Segment | Institution Count | Est. Tech Spend/Institution | Segment Value |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| R1 Universities | 187 | $200K-$500K | $37M-$94M |
| R2 Universities | 139 | $100K-$300K | $14M-$42M |
| Other 4-year (with advancement) | ~1,500 | $50K-$150K | $75M-$225M |
| Hospital foundations | ~5,000+ | $50K-$200K | $250M-$1B |
| **SAM Total** | — | — | **$376M-$1.36B** |

*Note: Tech spend estimates based on market data; actual figures vary significantly by institution size.*

## 8. Segmentation Analysis

### Segment Comparison Matrix

| Factor | R1/R2 Universities | Mid-tier Universities | Hospital Foundations | General Nonprofits |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Pain intensity | **Very High** | High | High | Medium |
| Budget availability | **High** | Medium | Medium-High | Low |
| Decision speed | Slow (6-12 mo) | Medium (3-6 mo) | Medium (3-6 mo) | Fast (1-3 mo) |
| Data sophistication | **High** | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Case study value | **Very High** | Medium | High | Low |
| Competitive intensity | High | Medium | Medium | High |
| Regulatory complexity | Medium (FERPA) | Medium | **High (HIPAA)** | Low |

### Beachhead Recommendation

**Primary:** R1/R2 Universities (326 institutions)

**Rationale:**
1. **Pain is acute:** 46% gift officer turnover, "beleaguered" technology, 58% increasing staff without tools to support them
2. **Budget exists:** Large endowments, dedicated advancement technology budgets, demonstrated willingness to pay ($3,375/mo+ for Blackbaud)
3. **Data is available:** Mature CRM usage, years of historical giving data, prospect research infrastructure
4. **Case studies matter:** R1 wins create credibility for entire market; peer influence is strong in higher ed
5. **Michael's network:** Domain expert partner has direct relationships in this segment

**Secondary (Phase 2):** Hospital foundations with >$5M annual revenue

**Avoid initially:** Small nonprofits (<$1M budget) — high price sensitivity, low data maturity, fragmented buying

---

## 9. Key Uncertainties & Data Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Specific tech spend by institution tier | Affects pricing strategy | Primary research with Michael's network |
| Gift officer count by institution size | Affects user-based pricing | CASE Advancement Investment Metrics (requires access) |
| Hospital foundation total count | Affects healthcare TAM | AHP membership data |
| Competitor pricing (Gravyty, EverTrue) | Affects positioning | Sales intelligence, G2/Capterra research |
| Willingness to pay for AI analytics | Affects business model | Customer discovery interviews |
