# Advancement Technology Buyer Personas (Universities)
**Use case:** AI-powered analytics + decisioning **overlay** for university advancement (integrates with existing CRM; no rip/replace).  
**Primary segment:** Research universities (R1/R2/RCU), but personas generalize across most 4-year institutions.

---

## 0) How to read this doc
Advancement tech deals are decided by:
- **Economic buyer (can say YES):** VP Advancement / CDO
- **Champion buyer (drives the process):** Advancement Services leader
- **Methodology validator (influences trust):** Prospect Research / Prospect Development leader
- **Adoption gate (makes it work or fail):** Major Gift Officers + frontline managers
- **Veto power (can say NO):** CIO / Enterprise Apps / Security

If you don’t win **security** and **adoption**, you don’t have a business.

---

## 1) Persona 1 — VP for Advancement / Chief Development Officer (CDO)
### Snapshot
- **Role in deal:** Economic buyer + political sponsor
- **Primary job:** Raise money and protect institutional reputation while keeping the fundraising engine productive.
- **What they actually care about:** pipeline health, major gift velocity, forecast reliability, campaign progress, donor retention.

### Typical background
- Career fundraiser (major gifts/campaigns), often moved up through leadership.
- Board-facing, president-facing, donor-facing.

### Responsibilities
- Set fundraising strategy, targets, and accountability.
- Align stakeholders: deans, president, trustees, volunteer leadership.
- Own staffing, fundraising performance, and risk management.

### Success metrics (KPIs)
- Dollars raised (by campaign/year), pledge vs cash, participation/retention
- Pipeline coverage, major gift stage movement, proposal volume, visit metrics
- Forecast accuracy and executive reporting credibility

### Top pain points
- Forecasts don’t match reality; reporting is slow and contested.
- Gift officer portfolios are bloated, stale, and political.
- Data exists but isn’t trusted or usable in weekly decisions.
- Too many tools; too little lift.

### Technology sophistication
- Medium. Cares about outcomes + risk; delegates the technical details.

### Budget authority & thresholds
- High influence on approvals; often needs:
  - IT/security buy-in (non-negotiable)
  - procurement/legal involvement above certain thresholds
  - occasionally CFO/president sign-off for large multi-year commitments

### Trusted information sources
- Peer VPs/CDOs, CASE networks, consultants/search firms, board conversations
- “What did [peer institution] do?” is decisive.

### What makes them say yes
- Clear, measurable lift: portfolio quality, meeting volume, proposal velocity, dollars raised.
- Peer references from institutions they respect.
- Low disruption: complements the CRM, doesn’t force process chaos.
- Strong security posture so they don’t get burned.

### What kills deals
- “AI hype” without evidence.
- Implementation that looks like a multi-quarter IT project.
- Weak references / unknown vendor risk.
- Fear of political fallout (“another tool MGOs won’t use”).

### How to sell to them (message)
> “We improve pipeline health and gift officer productivity without replacing your CRM—measurable in 60–90 days.”
