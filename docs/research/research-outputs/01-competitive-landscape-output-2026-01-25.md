**Research Date:** 2026-01-25
**Research Brief:** 01-competitive-landscape.md
**Status:** Complete (web search execution)

---

## Executive Summary

The advancement technology competitive landscape is **fragmented and ripe for disruption**. Key findings:

1. **No dominant AI-first player** in higher ed advancement analytics — Gravyty focuses on engagement/outreach, EverTrue on data aggregation, but neither delivers comprehensive AI-powered intelligence layer
2. **Incumbents are adding AI features reactively** — Blackbaud's AI roadmap is incremental (acknowledgments, copilot preview); Salesforce Einstein is powerful but expensive ($900/user/year)
3. **Recent consolidation** — EverTrue acquired DonorSearch (Sept 2025), Gravyty acquired by K1/merged with Ivy.ai/Ocelot, Fundraise Up raised $70M (Jan 2025)
4. **Pricing gap exists** — Blackbaud at $3,375/mo, iWave at $3,745/yr, Bloomerang at $125/mo — room for mid-market AI analytics

**Strategic positioning opportunity:** "Intelligence layer" that complements (not competes with) CRMs, focuses on gift officer workflow optimization and portfolio analytics — a gap no competitor fully owns.

## 5. Whitespace & Positioning Opportunities

### Gap Analysis

| Gap | Current Solutions | Opportunity |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|
| **Portfolio analytics for gift officers** | Gravyty (outreach focus), Ovrture (stewardship) | Daily "who to call" intelligence with predictive scoring |
| **CRM-agnostic AI layer** | Most tools require specific CRM or are CRMs | Overlay that works with Blackbaud, Salesforce, or any export |
| **Affordable AI for mid-market** | Salesforce Einstein ($900/user), DonorSearch (custom) | $2K-5K diagnostic entry point |
| **Advancement health benchmarking** | No public peer comparison tool | CASE-style metrics with AI-generated insights |
| **Retention risk detection** | Bloomerang (CRM-locked) | Cross-platform lapse prediction |

### Recommended Positioning

**"The intelligence layer that makes your CRM useful"**

1. **Don't compete with CRMs** — Blackbaud/Salesforce are entrenched
2. **Don't compete with wealth screening** — EverTrue/DonorSearch own this
3. **Own the "daily workflow intelligence" gap** — Tell gift officers exactly who to contact, when, and why
4. **Lead with diagnosis** — Health Assessment as trust-building entry point
