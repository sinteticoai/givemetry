## The Problem

Advancement offices at universities, hospitals, and nonprofits sit on years of donor data they can't use effectively. Gift officers manage 150+ prospects each with no systematic way to know who to call, when to call them, or what to ask for. CRM systems capture data but provide no intelligence. The result: missed opportunities, burned-out staff, and donors who feel like ATMs rather than partners in a mission.

The incumbents in this space — particularly Blackbaud — are widely disliked but deeply entrenched. Organizations know their data could work harder for them, but they lack the tools to make it happen.

## The Opportunity

AI has reached a threshold where meaningful donor intelligence is now possible without massive data science teams. Advancement leaders are actively seeking solutions. But they're skeptical of vendors promising to replace their systems or revolutionize their operations overnight.

They don't need another CRM. They need an intelligence layer that makes their existing systems useful.

## What GiveMetry Does

GiveMetry is an AI-powered platform that transforms donor data into actionable intelligence for advancement teams.

**For gift officers:** Know exactly who to contact, when, and what to say — every single day. No more guesswork, no more stale portfolios, no more missed opportunities.

**For advancement leadership:** See the health of your operation at a glance. Understand where you're leaving money on the table. Make data-driven decisions about staffing, strategy, and campaign goals.

**For the organization:** Raise more money with the team you have. Build stronger, longer-lasting donor relationships. Reduce gift officer burnout and turnover.

## How We Get There

### Phase 1: Health Assessment (Now)

A diagnostic tool that shows organizations exactly where their advancement operation is strong and where it's leaking value. Works with data they already have. No integration required — upload a file, get insights.

This validates demand, builds relationships, and establishes GiveMetry as a trusted partner before asking for deeper access.

### Phase 2: MGO Copilot (Near-term)

A daily workflow tool for gift officers. Connects to existing CRMs and provides prioritized task lists, donor briefs before meetings, outreach drafts, and relationship health scores. The gift officer stays in control; GiveMetry handles the analysis and preparation.

### Phase 3: Advancement Intelligence Platform (Medium-term)

Expanded capabilities for the full advancement office: campaign forecasting, portfolio optimization, predictive modeling for donor behavior, and automated stewardship workflows. Enterprise features for larger institutions with complex needs.

## Why GiveMetry Wins

**We're an overlay, not a replacement.** Organizations don't have to rip out Blackbaud or fight a two-year procurement battle. We make their existing investment work better.

**We start with diagnosis.** Instead of promising transformation, we show them exactly what's broken first. Trust before commitment.

**We understand the domain.** Advancement isn't generic sales. The language, the relationships, the cycles, the sensitivities — we speak their language and respect how they work.

**We're building for the long game.** Not a feature demo looking for acqui-hire. A platform that becomes essential infrastructure for how advancement offices operate.

## The Vision

Every advancement office — from small colleges to major research universities to hospital foundations — operates with the same quality of donor intelligence that today only the largest, best-resourced institutions can afford.

Gift officers spend their time building relationships, not wrestling with data. Donors feel known and valued, not processed. Organizations raise more money to fund the missions that matter.

GiveMetry is the intelligence layer that makes this possible.
