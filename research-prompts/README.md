# GiveMetry Deep Research Prompts

Research prompts designed for deep research tools (Claude Research, Perplexity Pro, Gemini Deep Research).

## Execution Sequence

| Order | File | Focus | Best Tool |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `02-market-sizing.md` | TAM/SAM/SOM, segmentation, beachhead identification | Perplexity Pro, Gemini |
| 2 | `01-competitive-landscape.md` | Competitor profiles, feature matrix, positioning gaps | Claude Research, Perplexity Pro |
| 3 | `03-buyer-personas.md` | Buyer profiles, purchase process, decision criteria | Claude Research |

## Why This Order?

1. **Market sizing first** — Quantifying the opportunity and identifying the beachhead segment informs which competitors to prioritize and which buyer personas matter most.

2. **Competitive landscape second** — With segment focus established, competitive research can be targeted to relevant players in that space.

3. **Buyer personas third** — Understanding how buyers in your chosen segment evaluate and purchase ensures GTM strategy aligns with reality.

## Output Handling

Save research outputs to `/opt/apps/givemetry/research-outputs/` with naming convention:
- `01-competitive-landscape-output-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `02-market-sizing-output-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `03-buyer-personas-output-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Next Steps After Research

Once all three briefs are complete, consolidate findings into:
1. **Project Brief** — Strategic foundation document
2. **PRD** — Product requirements for Phase 1 (Advancement Health Assessment)
